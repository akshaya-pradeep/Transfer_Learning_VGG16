Transfer Learning-based Face Mask Detection with VGG16

I have recently implemented a Mask Detection Model based on Transfer Learning with VGG16. Rather than training a CNN from scratch, I used VGG16 (pre-trained on ImageNet) and fine-tuned it to classify images into With Mask and Without Mask categories.

- Pre-trained VGG16 for feature extraction

- Freezed convolutional layers to preserve learned patterns

- Fine-tuned fully connected layers for mask classification

- ImageDataGenerator for real-time data augmentation

- Visualized training vs. validation accuracy & loss

- Custom prediction function to classify new images

This project shows how transfer learning improves deep learning models by making them more efficient, saving time and resources! Can't wait to explore more real-world AI applications.
